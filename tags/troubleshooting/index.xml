    <description><![CDATA[<p>At some point we have all come across update issues with error messages like &ldquo;Update install failed.&quot;, without any further details available. In my opinion there should be more details on an UI to further troubleshoot issues like that, but when it comes to upgrade procedures on FMC that is about it.</p>
<p>So how exactly should we start analyzing upgrade issues on FMC? Although the UI output is rather generic there is lots of information to be found using the CLI. Each upgrade procedure consists of a variaty of scripts that are being executed on the device that is being upgraded.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever been in a situation where you wanted to verify the actual access control policy deployed to your sensor?
When I first started looking around on how to do this from a firepower sensor cli I found the following command  <code>show access-control-config</code> which displays a human readable version of the full access control policy. After some updates that misbehaved I was looking for an easy method to dump my policy before starting an upgrade so I can do a <code>diff</code> between my policy before the upgrade and after the upgrade.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Troubleshooting user identity issues on firepower systems can be quite daunting at times if you do not know where exactly you should look for issues. After encountering many different problems I thought it might be a good idea write down what I have learned from various troubleshooting sessions since unfortunately the amount of available documentation is quite lacking.</p>]]></description>
