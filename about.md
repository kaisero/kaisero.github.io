I am a Systems Engineer who focuses on ip networks and automation. I like to tinker around with various technologies and write about the things I encounter during projects and day to day operations. 
In my free time I am working (more or less successfully) on some python projects and try to learn new stuff. When I am not in front of a computer I spend my time working out or lazing around
on the couch.
